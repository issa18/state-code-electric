        text: "Had an issue with outlet under the kitchen sink, rendering my garbage disposal and sink useless for Thanksgiving. Called State Code Electric Friday morning and Antonio (owner) was able to fit me in. Did a great job at a reasonable price and kept me informed on everything he was doing the entire time. State Code Electric is the only electrician I will consider for future work in the Baytown area!",

There seemed to be no way possible to get power to the center of the ceiling but State Code Electric found a way. He didn't give up and found a solution to what seemed an impossible task. I highly recommend him and will definitely use him again for any electrical issues we run into. Thanks State Code Electric for your hard work.",

Antonio who I believe is the owner promptly call me back after I left a message and was able to come out and give me an estimate the following day. Due to it is summertime his schedule was pretty booked but he knew that I wanted my issue to be addressed as soon as possible and cleared his morning schedule for me just to fix my problem. I am so grateful and thankful Antonio and his team. He was very professional, prompt, polite and affordable. I will use this company from now on. Thank you!",

He has been super quick to reply both times we called and has shown up within a few hours each time!  He fixed both issues quickly (one was an electrical issue in the main living area, the other was a faulty garage door), he explains what he did to fix the issues, and he is super friendly!  Don't hesitate to call State Code Electric!",
